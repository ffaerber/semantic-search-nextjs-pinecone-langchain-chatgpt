ABOUT Felix

I have been working as a web developer for over 15 years, working for large listed companies such as Audi, Hermes, Telefonica or EnBW as well as small, rapidly growing start-ups (growth rates of 400% per year). My scope of work  is full stack, meaning  from UX and  frontend to backend down to the infrastructure. In the past years I have focused on development in JavaScript and in the DevOps area with Docker. With this know-how I have worked in various teams in recent years, sometimes as developer of the API gateways with unit and integration tests or as a DevOps developer who configured the CI/CD pipeline, logging and monitoring. As a lead developer, I guided and intrinsically motivated all team members with a hands-on mentality, which led to a healthy and positive working atmosphere and ultimately to a successful project.
